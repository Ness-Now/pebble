# PebbleLab Roadmap

## Phase 3.1 - Nearby Agents Social Perception V0

Status: done and validated.

Goal: abstract agents can observe nearby abstract agents by relative position
and Manhattan distance. This is perception only, not interaction.

## Phase 3.2 - LabGoal/currentGoal V0

Status: done and validated.

Goal: abstract agents choose a deterministic `currentGoal` before selecting an
action. This is not a planner and does not mutate the world.

## Phase 3.3 - health/fear/homePosition V0

Status: done and validated.

Goal: abstract agents track health, fear, and home position without pathfinding,
physical entities, inventory, or social relationships.

## Phase 3.4 - LabInventory Minimal V0

Status: done and validated.

Goal: abstract agents carry a small deterministic string-keyed inventory
without item registries, physical pickup, block interaction, crafting, or
sharing.

## Phase 3.5 - agents_basic Scenario And --agents N

Next recommended step: add a small scenario or CLI option that can create a
configurable number of abstract agents while keeping the current deterministic
logging and snapshot contracts.
